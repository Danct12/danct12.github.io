# about me

- Pronouns: he/him or they/them
- Age: {{< year >}}
- Interests: music, demoscene, photography, old computers

I'm a embedded system developer, you may know me as the maintainer of [Arch Linux on PinePhone](https://codeberg.org/DanctNIX/Pine64-Arch/releases) and from various Ubuntu Touch/SailfishOS device ports.

I love listening to music and I love discovering new genres, currently I listen to pop and heavy metal..

Demoscene is very cool. Ever since I started listening to tracker music, I got encouraged to check out demoscene videos and I started to love it. I still didn't get to make anything cool or even touched OpenMPT.. maybe some day..?

I rarely post stuffs here but I might start doing more writeups and post it on here now that I have redesigned my site.
