I'm a programmer, a Linux user. I'm that kind of person that is very interested in random technology stuff.

### What I do
- I worked on DTF2 server from 2013 - 2017 mainly for fun.
- I was a administrator at Moddage from 2016 - 2019.
- I was a postmarketOS core developer for short period of time before getting busy.
- I am a Linux kernel contributor, mainly on the embedded/mobile side of the kernel.
